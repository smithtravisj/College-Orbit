Anyone else have assignments buried in Canvas that you forget about? I missed a final project worth 20% of my grade because of this.

Also has:
- GPA tracker with credit hours

```
Tool that finally fixed my assignment organization problem
```

**Body:**
```
I've tried Notion, Google Calendar, physical planners, reminders... nothing stuck because I had to manually enter everything.

The problem was my assignments live in Canvas, and I'm too lazy to copy them elsewhere.

So I built something that syncs Canvas automatically. It's called College Orbit.

You connect your Canvas account and it pulls all your assignments, due dates, and exams. Then shows them in a timeline so you can see what's coming up.

Also tracks GPA and has a built-in pomodoro timer.

Made an app because I kept forgetting assignments existed
```

**Body:**
```
I have ADHD and "check Canvas regularly" has never worked for me. Out of sight = out of mind.

I'd literally forget entire assignments existed until someone mentioned them in class.

So I built an app that:
1. Syncs with Canvas automatically (I don't have to remember to check)
2. Shows a timeline of EVERYTHING coming up (classes, deadlines, exams)
3. Sends reminders before things are due

It's called College Orbit: collegeorbit.app

The timeline view is what helps me most - one glance and I know what I need to do today.

Free to use. Just wanted to share in case it helps anyone else who struggles with this.

So I built College Orbit. It syncs with Canvas automatically and shows everything in a timeline view.

Also has:
- GPA/grade tracking
- Notes with file attachments
- Calendar export

### 15. Quora Answers

**Search for these questions and answer them:**

**Question:** "How do I stay organized in college?"

**Your answer:**
```
Organization in college comes down to one thing: having a system you'll actually use.

I tried everything - Notion, Google Calendar, physical planners. Nothing stuck because I had to manually enter assignments.

What finally worked: an app that syncs with Canvas automatically.

I use College Orbit (collegeorbit.app). You connect your Canvas account and it pulls all your assignments, due dates, and exams automatically. Shows everything in a timeline so you can see what's coming up.

The key is removing friction. If you have to manually enter stuff, you won't do it consistently. Automation is the answer.
```

**Question:** "What are the best apps for college students?"

**Your answer:**
```
Here are the apps I actually use daily:

1. **College Orbit** (collegeorbit.app) - Syncs with Canvas and shows all my deadlines in one place. Also tracks GPA.

2. **Notion** - For long-form notes and project planning

3. **Google Calendar** - For scheduling (College Orbit exports to this)

4. **Forest** - Focus timer (though College Orbit has a built-in pomodoro timer too)

The game-changer for me was having my Canvas assignments sync automatically. I stopped missing deadlines completely.
```

**Question:** "How do I stop forgetting assignments?"

**Your answer:**
```
The problem is usually that your assignments live in Canvas (or another LMS) and you have to remember to check it.

Out of sight = out of mind.

The solution is to get your assignments OUT of Canvas and into something you'll actually look at.

I built an app called College Orbit that does this automatically. You connect Canvas and it syncs all your assignments, due dates, and exams. Then shows them in a timeline.

collegeorbit.app

Free to use. It's saved me from missing multiple deadlines already.

### 17. YouTube Video Script

**Title:** "The App That's Saving My GPA (Canvas Sync)"

**Script:**

```
[HOOK - first 5 seconds]
I used to miss at least one assignment every semester because it was buried in Canvas. Then I built this.

[INTRO]
Hey, I'm [name]. I'm a college student and I built an app called College Orbit because I was tired of forgetting deadlines.

Let me show you how it works.

[DEMO - Screen record the app]
When you first sign up, you connect your Canvas account. It uses the official Canvas API so it's secure.

Once connected, it automatically syncs all your courses, assignments, and exams.

Here's the timeline view - this is what I check every morning. It shows today's classes, tasks due soon, upcoming exams - everything in one place.

You can also see your GPA and how each class is affecting it.

The notes feature lets you attach files - super useful for lecture slides.

And there's a built-in pomodoro timer for study sessions.

[WHY I BUILT IT]
I built this because I tried everything - Notion, Google Calendar, sticky notes. Nothing worked because I had to manually enter assignments.

With College Orbit, it syncs automatically. I literally just have to open the app and I know exactly what I need to do.

[CTA]
It's free to try at collegeorbit.app. Link in the description.

If you're a college student who struggles with organization, give it a shot. And let me know in the comments what features you'd want added.

Thanks for watching!
```

```
Yes! Free to use with up to 3 courses. Premium ($3/month) unlocks unlimited courses.

Yes, it uses the official Canvas API with a personal access token. I never see your Canvas password. You can revoke access anytime.

Currently Canvas only, but Blackboard, Moodle, and Brightspace are on the roadmap! You can join the beta to try new features first.

You can still use it! Just manually add your courses, assignments, and exams. The timeline, GPA tracker, and notes work without Canvas sync.

Main difference: automatic Canvas sync. No manual entry. Your assignments just appear. Plus it's built specifically for students with features like GPA tracking.
